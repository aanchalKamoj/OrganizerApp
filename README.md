# OrganizerApp

I am new to github. 
This is a very basic project in PYQT for organize the files in your system.
When you will select any drive from the drop down you can see your all files present in your selected drive.
This will make it easy for you if you have n numbers of files in your drive.
This will differentiate the files on the basis of their extension.
There is scope to do better like i just want to open the file directly from this app also I want to make a folder as per their extension.
Also it will not work on the windows as I have created it on Linux
