I am new to github. I am trying to find the option for description of project but did not find SO I am crearing this file to describe
my project.
This is a very basic project in PYQT for organize the files in your system.
When you will select any drive from the drop down you can see your all files present in your selected drive.
This will make it easy for you if you have n numbers of files in your drive.
This will differentiate the files on the basis of their extension.
There is scope to do better like i just want to open the file directly from this app alose I want to make a folder as per their extension.
Also it wil not work on the windpws as I have created it on Linux
